# **Blockchain for Cross-Border Payments with Minimal Intermediaries**


### Objective
Cross-border payments are essential to global commerce but often face delays and high costs due to intermediary banks. When two banks have a direct relationship, transfers are straightforward; otherwise, a chain of “correspondent” banks may be needed, adding complexity and fees.

Advances in communication and expanded banking networks have helped reduce these delays. Currently, 84% of global payments are either direct or involve just one intermediary. According to Thierry Chilosi, Chief Strategy Officer at Swift, 89% of payments on the Swift network reach the destination bank within an hour, with half reaching the beneficiary account in under five minutes.

### Part 1: Direct Bank-to-Bank Payments

1. **Establishing Direct Links**  
   - Facilitate direct relationships between banks in different countries, reducing the need for intermediaries.

2. **Efficient Payment Messaging**  
   - Use advanced payment messaging systems to streamline communication, allowing for faster crediting and debiting of accounts.

3. **Swift Network Optimization**  
   - Leverage Swift’s existing network to minimize intermediaries and expedite transactions.

### Part 2: Optimizing Correspondent Banking

1. **Single Correspondent Partner Setup**  
   - Establish a single intermediary for banks without direct relationships, ensuring quick transactions with minimal partners.

2. **Intermediary Efficiency Improvement**  
   - Automate intermediary processes, reducing the steps required for payment completion.

3. **Enhanced Reporting and Tracking**  
   - Provide real-time tracking and reporting to monitor payment status, ensuring transparency for both senders and recipients.

### Deliverables

1. **Direct Bank-to-Bank Payment System**  
   - A solution enabling banks to communicate directly or through minimal intermediaries, reducing delays.

2. **Correspondent Bank Optimization Module**  
   - A module for efficient correspondent bank interactions to streamline multi-partner transactions.

3. **Global Payments Dashboard**  
   - A user interface allowing real-time monitoring and reporting of transaction progress across borders.
