# web3-problem-statement-2 : Blockchain for Cross-Border Payments with Minimal Intermediaries


### Objective
Traditional cross-border payments often require multiple intermediaries, slowing down transactions and increasing costs. However, with advances in communications technology and banking relationships, cross-border payments are now significantly faster. The objective of this project is to develop a solution to enable efficient, near-instant global payments.

### Part 1: Direct Bank-to-Bank Payments

1. **Establishing Direct Links**  
   - Facilitate direct relationships between banks in different countries, reducing the need for intermediaries.

2. **Efficient Payment Messaging**  
   - Use advanced payment messaging systems to streamline communication, allowing for faster crediting and debiting of accounts.

3. **Swift Network Optimization**  
   - Leverage Swiftâ€™s existing network to minimize intermediaries and expedite transactions.

### Part 2: Optimizing Correspondent Banking

1. **Single Correspondent Partner Setup**  
   - Establish a single intermediary for banks without direct relationships, ensuring quick transactions with minimal partners.

2. **Intermediary Efficiency Improvement**  
   - Automate intermediary processes, reducing the steps required for payment completion.

3. **Enhanced Reporting and Tracking**  
   - Provide real-time tracking and reporting to monitor payment status, ensuring transparency for both senders and recipients.

### Deliverables

1. **Direct Bank-to-Bank Payment System**  
   - A solution enabling banks to communicate directly or through minimal intermediaries, reducing delays.

2. **Correspondent Bank Optimization Module**  
   - A module for efficient correspondent bank interactions to streamline multi-partner transactions.

3. **Global Payments Dashboard**  
   - A user interface allowing real-time monitoring and reporting of transaction progress across borders.

This project aims to simplify cross-border payments, offering a more efficient and accessible global payment system.
